                Each category will have 3 prize categories, 1st â€“ 3rd. Awards will be based on the working product/prototype, customer communication, creative problem-solving, user aesthetics, and presentation.
                Apart from the main hackathon competition, participants can also indulge in fun-filled mini-games that offer exciting prizes. These mini-games provide a break from the intense competition and offer a chance to unwind while still enjoying the thrill of competition and winning prizes.
